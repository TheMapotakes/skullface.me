Hihi, nice to meet you! (*Ôºæ‚ñΩÔºæ)Ôºè I‚Äôm skullface (she/her) and I‚Äôm a **Design Engineer dual-wielding compassion and cuteness**, using my interdisciplinary background to make positive impact and leave a trail of glitter in my wake.

## Design philosophy
As a tween who liked playing on the computer more than playing outside, I fell in love with design as soon as I found out it had a name. I practice design as code, as strategy, as content, as experience, as visual expression ‚Äî as the native medium of the world wide web. I‚Äôm a <dfn title="Hybrid Designer and Front-End Engineer, formerly referred to as a ‚Äúunicorn‚Äù">Design Engineer</dfn> with a focus on growth, inclusivity, and operations (&hearts; accessibility, representation, clear async comms, marketing üìà, codifying and re-calibrating processes, and great documentation). Design can‚Äôt save the world, but we have an immense responsibility as technology practicioners to _do the most good_ as we serve business goals.
